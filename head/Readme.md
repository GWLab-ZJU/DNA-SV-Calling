# Readme

This folder contains some *head* files which will be attached in front of `do.sh` and `lsf.sh`. Multiple constants are defined here.

A detailed guide of global configurations presents in the Readme file under root directory of the pipeline. Please be aware that some programs have their own constants which will overwrite the defaults.
